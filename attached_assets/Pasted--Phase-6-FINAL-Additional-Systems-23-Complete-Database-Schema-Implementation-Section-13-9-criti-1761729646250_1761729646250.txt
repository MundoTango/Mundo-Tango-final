üéØ Phase 6 FINAL Additional Systems
23. Complete Database Schema Implementation (Section 13)
9 critical tables we need to implement/enhance:

build_tasks - Orchestration task tracking (buildId, dependencies, priority, timing)
agent_capabilities - Already have (114 agents), enhance with load balancing
agent_collaboration - Inter-agent messaging (task handoffs, status updates)
agent_learnings - Already have, integrate with Agent #80
ai_usage_metrics - Already have, enhance cost tracking
user_behavior_patterns - ML input (navigation paths, peak times, frustration points)
ml_predictions - AI predictions with confidence scores & feedback
failed_actions - Error tracking table (resolution status, learning source)
failure_patterns - Aggregated failures (recommendations, prevention strategies)
24. Self-Awareness Advanced Features (Section 8)
Agent #0 needs to know 350+ agents (not just 114):

Platform Knowledge Loading: Load mb.md, org charts on init
Query Detection: Pattern matching for meta-questions
4 Response Types: Capabilities, Identity, Ecosystem, Dependencies
Cost Optimization: Answer meta-questions without AI API calls
Hardcoded Knowledge: 350+ agents, 9 core agents, 7 intelligence agents, 12 capabilities
25. Security & Safety Systems (Section 7.6)
Path Traversal Prevention: Whitelist allowed directories
SQL Injection Prevention: Parameterized queries, result limits
Command Injection Prevention: Block execSync, whitelist commands
Authorization Checks: Super admin only for dangerous tools
Audit Logging: All tool calls tracked with user ID
26. Error Handling & Recovery
Failed Actions Tracking: failed_actions table
Failure Pattern Analysis: failure_patterns aggregation
Self-Healing: Max 3 retry attempts before escalation
Exponential Backoff: Retry logic with delays
Error Learning: Capture errors in agent_learnings
27. Performance Optimization Systems
Agent Load Balancing: Track currentLoad vs maxLoad
Response Time Tracking: avgResponseTime per agent
Priority Queue: Task priority 1-10 scoring
Dependency Resolution: Parallel execution where possible
Progress Monitoring: Real-time task status updates
28. WebSocket Real-Time Architecture
We have WebSocket server, but mb.md specifies:

Agent Status Broadcasting: Live agent availability updates
Task Progress Events: Real-time completion notifications
Collaboration Messages: Agent-to-agent communication
Priority Messaging: Critical messages bypass queue
Connection Health: Auto-reconnect on failures
29. Future Roadmap Implementation (Section 20)
Even though planned for 2026, we can start building:

Q1 2026 Systems:

Gemini 2.5 Pro Expansion (when API available)
Enhanced Self-Healing (beyond 3 retries)
Advanced Pattern Recognition (Agent #113 enhancements)
Automated Performance Optimization
Q2 2026 Systems:

Agent-to-Agent Learning (peer learning network)
Advanced Consensus Mechanisms (weighted voting)
Real-time Collaboration Features (simultaneous multi-agent work)
Enhanced MCP Integrations (200+ MCP tools)
Q3 2026 Systems:

Multi-Agent Swarm Intelligence (emergent behavior)
Predictive Error Prevention (predict failures before they happen)
Autonomous Security Audits (self-scanning)
Self-Optimizing Architecture (AI optimizes its own code)
30. Testing Protocol Implementation (Section 16)
4 Mandatory Checkpoints for every agent action:

Data Inspection: Always inspect data structures first (console.log)
Unit Testing: Test functions in isolation
Integration Testing: Full user journey end-to-end
Architect Review: Evidence-based (screenshots, logs, metrics)
31. Git Operations System (Agent #126)
AI-Generated Commit Messages: Claude writes semantic commits
Pre-commit Validation: Linting, tests before commit
Branch Management: Feature branches, PR automation
Git Workflow Automation: Auto-commit after successful tests
32. Cost Optimization Deep Dive (Section 6)
Full multi-model routing we haven't fully implemented:

Request Analysis: Keyword detection (simple UI vs complex)
Model Selection: Gemini Flash ($0.001) vs Pro ($0.01) vs Claude ($0.15)
70/20/10 Distribution: 70% Flash, 20% Pro, 10% Claude
Cost Tracking per Request: Log every API call with model + tokens
Budget Alerts: Notify when approaching spending limits
