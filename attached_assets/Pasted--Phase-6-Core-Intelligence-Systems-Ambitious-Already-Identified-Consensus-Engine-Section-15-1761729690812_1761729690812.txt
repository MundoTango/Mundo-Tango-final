ðŸ§  Phase 6: Core Intelligence Systems (Ambitious)
Already Identified:
âœ… Consensus Engine (Section 15) - Agent decision voting & collaboration
âœ… Self-Awareness System (Section 8) - Agent #0 CEO orchestrator intelligence
âœ… Vibe Code Engine (Section 9/11) - Agent #131 autonomous coding
Additional Core Systems:
MCP Integration (Section 5)

Model Context Protocol client manager
Connect to Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion via MCP servers
Dynamic tool discovery (100+ MCP tools)
Health monitoring for MCP connections
Universal Tool Orchestrator (Section 7)

Platform tools (20+): read_file, write_file, execute_sql, search_codebase
Multi-model tool calling (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini)
Security hardening (path traversal, SQL injection prevention)
Tool execution tracking & metrics
Agent Learning & Memory System (Section 10)

Knowledge distribution across all agents
Bug fix learnings (AGENT_LEARNINGS.md integration)
Best practices & anti-patterns database
Agent memory service (agent_learnings table)
Intelligence Network (Section 10.4-10.7)

Agent #113: Pattern Recognition (detect code patterns)
Agent #114: Federated Learning (distributed learning)
Agent #115: Knowledge Graph (relationship mapping)
Agent #116: Meta-Intelligence (learning about learning)
ðŸ“‹ Architecture Benefits
This creates a self-improving system:

Agents vote on architecture decisions â†’ better choices
Agent #0 understands its own capabilities â†’ smarter orchestration
Agent #131 codes autonomously â†’ 20-50x productivity
MCP tools expand capabilities â†’ connect to any service
Learning system captures knowledge â†’ fewer repeat errors
Intelligence network analyzes patterns â†’ predictive optimization
