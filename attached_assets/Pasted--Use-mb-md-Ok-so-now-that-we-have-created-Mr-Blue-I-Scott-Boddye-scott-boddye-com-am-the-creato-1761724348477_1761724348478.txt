Use mb.md: Ok so now that we have created Mr Blue. I, Scott Boddye scott@boddye.com, am the creator Of Mundo Tango. I need you to look at all of the repositories that I'm giving you, this is the entire history of Mundo Tango being built. the most recent is the https://github.com/MundoTango/Mundo_Tango_App_emergent/tree/10-21-2025 Fork this was at the end of my journey I was having lots of issues creating Mr Blue the AI chatbot, which is both for standard users and super admins. As a super admin, it gives the ability to visually edit the site and Mr Blue is given superpowers to fully understand everything about Mundo Tango so it can be changed from the design perspective, basically we have created a Vibe coating agent similar to replant and others. I was having lots of problems with it so that's when I decided to stop there and recalibrate. in that repo you will find a lot of work on the Mr Blue AI agent. I want this to be the main reference for Mr Blue. this repo is what I have given you so far from the original mb.md doc I gave you. , if you feel like there was something missing from the original file i gave you then be on the lookout for that here.

Next is https://github.com/MundoTango/Mundo_Tango_App_emergent/tree/fresh-mundo-tango, this became the parent of https://github.com/MundoTango/Mundo_Tango_App_emergent/tree/10-21-2025 because the repo above, https://github.com/MundoTango/Mundo_Tango_App_emergent/tree/conflict_100925_1852 ( we will come to in a moment),had been compromised they were issues with deployment and and many other things and Replit encouraged me to start a new branch.  that's what I did and that branch is https://github.com/MundoTango/Mundo_Tango_App_emergent/tree/fresh-mundo-tango. The focus here in this Branch is that it's where I further germinated what Mr Blue is by knowing what the platform is and building up from there so I trained him on all of the things to be the Mundo Tango agent.

In https://github.com/MundoTango/Mundo_Tango_App_emergent/tree/conflict_100925_1852, This is the repo where we got really strict about documenting everything, really the true first stages of Mr Blue, at least I think. the main focus here was of course the documentation and the start of Mr Blue which was esa.md with all of the original agents layers and phases,. this should have orchestration, communication, back and forth between colleague agents and upward for help when needed, and more but I'll let you find the rest of that with what i have given you about Mr blue. the other main thing is that we did this deep dive into the the platform itself we started at the memories feed and we audited from there: 
we audited the memories feed itself, the post-creation and everything that goes into that,
the feed itself how things look, feel, and what the algorithm is, 
the right hand side upcoming events module and how those work and and how they connect, 
the top bar with search and language and all of that we did a lot of work on each of those deeply,  
the left sidebar menu where it has events and the Tango community. 
the Tango community making sure that the the pins on the map actually connected to the citigroups which are autonomously connected when a new user is indicates that they live in that City or if it's a new event or if it's a new recommendation anything that can be tied to a specific city is when something goes there.
groups we audited by working on Buenos aries as the template and all of those to make sure those are actually working,
 once the city is created then we have everything to do about that City and again this all of this was deeply documented and worked on.
