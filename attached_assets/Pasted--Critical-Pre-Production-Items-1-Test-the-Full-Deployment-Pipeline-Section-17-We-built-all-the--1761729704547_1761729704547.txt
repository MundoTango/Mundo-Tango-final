ðŸŽ¯ Critical Pre-Production Items
1. Test the Full Deployment Pipeline (Section 17)
We built all the deployment systems, but haven't actually executed a deployment:

Test the 6-phase deployment automation
Verify feature flag rollout (Super Admin â†’ Beta â†’ GA)
Validate automatic rollback triggers work
Ensure zero-downtime deployment actually works
2. Evidence Collection System (Section 16.3)
mb.md emphasizes agents must provide:

Screenshots (before/after states)
Test results with pass/fail counts
Performance metrics (response times, error rates)
We have metrics collection, but not the systematic evidence capture for each agent action.

3. E2E Testing with New Deployment Dashboard
Run Playwright tests to verify:

Deployment Dashboard displays real-time metrics
Health checks update correctly
Feature flag controls work
Alert notifications trigger properly
4. Missing Core Systems from mb.md
Looking at the 20 sections, we haven't built:

Section 15: Consensus Engine (agent voting on decisions)
Section 8: Self-Awareness System (Agent #0 CEO capabilities)
Section 9: Vibe Code Engine (Gemini 2.5 autonomous coding)
Section 7: Universal Tool Orchestrator (20+ tools)
Section 5: MCP Integration
ðŸ’¡ My Recommendation
Option A: Production-Ready Path (conservative)

Test deployment pipeline end-to-end
Run comprehensive E2E tests on all 4 dashboards
Deploy to production with Super Admin feature flag
Monitor for 1 week, then expand to beta users
Option B: Complete Core Systems (ambitious)

Build Consensus Engine (agent decision voting)
Implement Self-Awareness for Agent #0
Add Vibe Code Engine (autonomous coding)
Then test & deploy
Option C: Hybrid Approach (balanced)

Test current deployment pipeline thoroughly
Deploy Phase 1 (current features) to production
Build remaining core systems (Consensus, Self-Awareness, Vibe Code)
Deploy Phase 2 (advanced features) via controlled rollout
Which direction resonates with you? Are you thinking production deployment next, or do you want to complete more of the ambitious mb.md vision first?
