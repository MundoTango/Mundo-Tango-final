ðŸŽ¯ Phase 6 Complete Scope (All Core Systems)
Already Identified (7 Systems):
Consensus Engine
Self-Awareness System (Agent #0)
Vibe Code Engine (Agent #131)
MCP Integration
Universal Tool Orchestrator
Agent Learning & Memory
Intelligence Network (Agents #113-116)
Additional Critical Systems:
8. ML Prediction & Behavior Analysis (Section 14)

Next Action Prediction - What will user do next? (60% historical + 20% time + 10% day + 10% context)
Enhanced Agent Assignment - ML-based agent selection (95% confidence matching)
Feature Recommendation - Suggest relevant features based on behavior
User Behavior Tracking - Navigation paths, peak times, frustration points
9. Specialized High-Value Agents (Section 12)

Agent #75: Avatar Manager - Luma Labs 3D avatar generation (photo-to-3D)
Agent #77: AI Site Builder - Natural language â†’ full website
Agent #78: Visual Editor - Figma-like click-to-edit UI inspector
10. Enhanced Multi-Agent Orchestration (Section 3)
We have basic orchestration, but mb.md specifies:

Advanced dependency resolution - Complex task graphs
Load balancing - Distribute work intelligently across 114 agents
Progress monitoring - Real-time task completion tracking
Error handling - Retry logic with exponential backoff
Database persistence - All tasks in build_tasks table
11. 61 Layer Agent Implementations (Section 12)
Individual agent files for each specialized domain:

Layer 4: Authentication System
Layer 16: Notification System
Layer 25: Messaging System
Layer 29: Booking System
Layer 31: AI Infrastructure
Layer 35: Agent Management
Layer 36: Memory Systems
Layer 37: Learning Systems

ðŸŽ¨ User-Facing Value
This creates a platform where users can:

"Build me a social network" â†’ Agent #131 codes it autonomously in 160min
"Make it look modern" â†’ Agent #78 opens visual editor to click & customize
"Add 3D avatars" â†’ Agent #75 integrates Luma Labs
Send emails/Slack from AI â†’ MCP connects to 100+ services
AI predicts what they want next â†’ ML system suggests features
Agents vote on best approach â†’ Consensus engine ensures quality
System learns from mistakes â†’ Never repeats errors
This is the complete mb.md vision - a self-aware, self-improving, autonomous AI platform that can build, learn, decide, and execute complex software projects with minimal human intervention.
