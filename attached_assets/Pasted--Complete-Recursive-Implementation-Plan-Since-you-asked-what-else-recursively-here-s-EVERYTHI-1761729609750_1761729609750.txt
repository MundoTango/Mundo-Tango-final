üéØ Complete Recursive Implementation Plan
Since you asked "what else, recursively" - here's EVERYTHING we need to build, going deeper into each system:

Level 1: Core Infrastructure (Already Done ‚úÖ)
Database schemas, API endpoints, WebSocket, Deployment systems
Level 2: Agent Intelligence Systems (Phase 6 - Identified)
38 system categories, 350+ agents, all the systems we discussed
Level 3: Actual Platform Features (User-Facing App)
3.1 Social Platform Database Schema:

- memories (posts, photos, videos, stories)
- events (name, date, location, attendees, tickets)
- groups (communities, members, permissions)
- messages (1:1 chat, group chat, read receipts)
- friendships (connections, followers, following)
- comments (on memories/events)
- reactions (likes, loves, emojis)
- media_files (S3/CDN storage)
3.2 Social Platform API Endpoints (50+ new):

POST   /api/memories
GET    /api/memories/:id
POST   /api/events
GET    /api/events
POST   /api/groups
POST   /api/messages
GET    /api/messages/:conversationId
POST   /api/friendships
... (35+ more endpoints)
3.3 Frontend Pages (15+ new React pages):

- Feed.tsx (memory stream)
- EventsPage.tsx (browse/create events)
- GroupsPage.tsx (communities)
- MessagingPage.tsx (chat interface)
- ProfilePage.tsx (user profile with 3D avatar)
- SettingsPage.tsx (account settings)
- SubscriptionPage.tsx (Stripe billing)
... (8+ more pages)
Level 4: Third-Party Integrations (Secure Setup)
Instead of hardcoding those API keys, we'll use Replit's integration system:

4.1 Stripe Integration:

Subscription tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
Payment processing
Webhook handlers
Invoice generation
4.2 Twilio Integration:

SMS 2FA
Event reminders
Support messaging
4.3 SendGrid Integration:

Welcome emails
Notification emails
Marketing campaigns
4.4 Luma Labs Integration:

Photo ‚Üí 3D avatar conversion
Avatar storage
4.5 OpenAI/Anthropic/Google AI:

Already have partial setup
Need to complete multi-model routing
Level 5: All 61 Layer Agent Implementations
Each layer agent needs its own implementation file:

server/agents/layer01-architecture.ts
server/agents/layer02-database.ts
server/agents/layer03-api.ts
... (58 more files)
Level 6: All 828 Documentation Files
Auto-generate markdown docs for each agent:

docs/agents/ceo/agent-0-orchestrator.md (573 lines)
docs/agents/chiefs/chief-1-foundation.md
docs/agents/layers/layer-01-architecture.md
... (825 more files)
Level 7: Complete Testing Suite
- E2E tests for every user journey (J1-J9)
- API tests for all 80+ endpoints
- Unit tests for all agents
- Integration tests for third-party services
- Load tests for WebSocket
- Security tests for authentication
Level 8: WebSocket Real-Time Architecture
- Presence system (who's online)
- Typing indicators
- Message delivery receipts
- Live notifications
- Real-time agent status
- Task progress broadcasting
üîê How We'll Handle Those API Keys Securely
I can see you have credentials for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Stripe, Twilio, SendGrid, and Luma Labs. Here's the secure approach:

Use Replit's Secret Management - I'll request them properly
Use Replit Integrations - Many services have pre-built integrations
Never commit secrets to code - Environment variables only
Let me search for available integrations and set this up properly:

I can create a comprehensive task list that includes:

‚úÖ Secure API integration setup (using Replit's tools, not hardcoded)
‚úÖ All 38 Phase 6 systems
‚úÖ Social platform features (memories, events, groups, messaging)
‚úÖ All 61 layer agents
‚úÖ Complete frontend UI
‚úÖ Documentation generation
‚úÖ Comprehensive testing
